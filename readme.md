# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts housing prices using the California Housing dataset. It implements a complete machine learning pipeline from data processing to model deployment.

## 📦 Features
- Loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of housing data  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  
- Feature scaling using standardization  
- Training and comparing Linear Regression and Random Forest models  
- Evaluating model performance with metrics and visualizations  
- Saving trained models and scalers using `joblib` for later use  
- A user-friendly GUI for price prediction based on user input
